```DAX
-- Total Customers
[Total Customers] = DISTINCTCOUNT('clients_data'[client_id])
```
```DAX
-- Average Credit Score
[Avg Credit Score] = AVERAGE('clients_data'[credit_score])
```
```DAX

[MC Transactions] =

    [Total Transactions],
    FILTER(ALL('cards_data'), 'cards_data'[card_brand] = "MasterCard")
)
```
```DAX
-- Visa
[Visa Transactions] =

    [Total Transactions],
    FILTER(ALL('cards_data'), 'cards_data'[card_brand] = "Visa")
)

```
```DAX

[Error Rate by Chip] =
DIVIDE(
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('transactions_data'), 'transactions_data'[error_flag] = 1, 'transactions_data'[use_chip] = "Yes"),
    CALCULATE(COUNTROWS('transactions_data'), 'transactions_data'[use_chip] = "Yes")
